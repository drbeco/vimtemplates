# vimtemplates

The VI Improved templates

## How to use this script

* Add `vimtemplates.vim` to your `~/.vim/plugin/` folder
* Add all `vimodelX.ext` files to your `~/.vim/templates/` folder
* Edit you `~/.vimrc` file and configure:
    - `let g:VIMFILESDIR="~/.vim/"`
    - `let g:author="Your Beautiful Name"`
    - `let g:email="nice@email.have.me"`
    - `let g:webpage='www.myextraordinary.example.com'`
    - `let g:phone="+55 (11) 1234-5678"`

* If you have doxgen plugin installed, you can use:
    - `let g:DoxygenToolkit_authorName=g:author`

That is basically it.

## Contributions

The *vimodels* I present covers a range of files but it is still just the beginnig. There are plenty of file extensions out there in need of a template.

This script is based on the original file-templates.vim
by Alan Budden, 2009, that can (probably) still be found [here](http://lucumr.pocoo.org/cogitations/2007/08/03/vim-file-templates/) [and here](https://sites.google.com/site/abudden/contents/Vim-Scripts/file-templates)

Feel free to help!

Contact by email at <cboeo@br.bb>, obviously obfuscated by the answer of the command:

`echo "my real email" | tr "crb@eo." "bcoe@r."`

Happy hacking.
